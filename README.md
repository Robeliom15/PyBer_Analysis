# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this script is to create a summary dataframe with the addition of a line graph. The summary dataframe will show the ride-sharing data by city type. The line graph will have three lines that show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

Looking at the image below you could see the differences between rural, suburban, and urban are vastly different. This makes sense given the difference in demand in the city types. There are fewer people in a rural environment, but we can see a massive demand for drivers in the area. Because of this rural drivers tend to have a higher average fare per driver and ride. When we move up to a suburban and urban environment the average fare per ride and driver decreases. There are more rides available but due to the higher number of drivers, we can see why there was a decrease.

## Summary

Overall, we can see that the three city types are quite different from each other due to the type of environments they have. Specifically, the rural city type has a high demand, but not enough drivers to satisfy it. Itâ€™s possible that if too many drivers are occupied then the potential business would be lost during peak hours. The suburban type could have a similar change since there are not as many drivers for rides. This change does not have to be as drastic as the rural type due to the fare having a fairly good rate. One issue about these changes is that the fare average per ride and driver may decrease. This is due to when there are more drivers compared to riders then the demand may go down.
