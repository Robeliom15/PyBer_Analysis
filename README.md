# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose

The purpose of this script is to create a summary dataframe with the addition of a line graph. The summary dataframe will show the ride-sharing data by city type. The line graph will have three lines that show the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results


Looking at the image below you could see the differences between rural, suburban, and urban are vastly different. This makes sense given the difference in demand in the city types. There are fewer people in a rural environment, but it could mean more demand for the drivers in the area. Rural drivers tend to have a higher average fare per driver and ride. When we move up to a suburban and urban environment the average fare per ride and driver decreases. There are more rides available but due to the higher number of drivers, we can see why there was a decrease.
